Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project – The Battle of Neighborhoods
Project Title:
“Guiding my Non-Pakistani colleagues to locate different food places, shopping malls and activities in the city Karachi, Pakistan.”
By: Sadaf Shehzad
1. Introduction/Business Problem:
The purpose of this Capstone Project is to help people in exploring best venues for food, malls and other social places around the Hotel Marriott, Karachi, Pakistan.
 It will also help people making smart and efficient choices on selecting great food varieties in different places in Karachi.
Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan and the twelfth largest city in the world. It is the capital of the Pakistani province of Sindh. Karachi is Pakistan’s premier industrial and financial center.
Karachi is known as the “City of Lights”.
Approximately 90% of the multinational corporations operating in Pakistan are headquartered in Karachi.
Last year a group of my colleagues had to visit Karachi on a business trip. They were staying in Marriott Hotel, Karachi. They inquired me about some of the best places to dine out, shopping and social gathering places.
So, I thought to make a project for my colleagues. Specifically, this report can provide a reference for any one, visiting Karachi for the first time, and those who are interested in exploring the different cuisines and shopping, offered there.
Foursquare API Data:
We will need data about different venues in different addresses of the places around Hotel Marriott. In order to gain that information, we will use “Foursquare” locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.
